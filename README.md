# autostart-detector
List every software set to autostart on bootup/login via registry or special folders. Autoruns based.


Autoruns is often used as a malware analysis tool for persistence mechanisms detection, so I will try to add cool functions related to that while I develop it.

In progress: 10%/100%.
